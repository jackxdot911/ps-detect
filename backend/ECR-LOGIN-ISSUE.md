# ECR Login Issue Resolution

## Problem
The deployment is failing with an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) login error. The specific error indicates that the `pass` password store is not initialized in your deployment environment:

```
Error saving credentials: error storing credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `error storing credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `pass not initialized: exit status 1: Error: password store is empty. Try "pass init".``
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

### Option 1: Initialize pass (Recommended for Linux systems)

1. First, generate a GPG key if you don't have one:
```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

2. Initialize pass with your GPG key ID:
```bash
pass init <your-gpg-key-id>
```

3. Try deploying again.

### Option 2: Configure Docker credentials store (Alternative solution)

1. Create or edit `~/.docker/config.json`:
```json
{
  "credHelpers": {
    "<your-aws-account-number>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com": "ecr-login"
  }
}
```

2. Install the Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper:
```bash
sudo apt-get install amazon-ecr-credential-helper  # For Ubuntu/Debian
# OR
sudo yum install amazon-ecr-credential-helper      # For Amazon Linux/RHEL
# OR
brew install docker-credential-helper-ecr          # For MacOS
```

3. Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured in `~/.aws/credentials` or via environment variables.

### Additional Notes
- Make sure you have the necessary AWS permissions to access ECR
- Verify your AWS credentials are properly configured
- If using CI/CD, ensure the build environment has the necessary tools installed

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future, consider:
1. Adding these setup steps to your deployment documentation
2. Including the necessary initialization in your CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. Using the ECR credential helper method in automated environments
